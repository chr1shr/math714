# UWâ€“Madison Math/CS 714: Code examples
Math/CS 514 is a graduate course taught at the University of Wisconsin, Madison on methods of computational mechanics.

The codes are primarily written in Python and make use of several
well-established libraries

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org) for numerical linear algebra
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org) for scientific routines and algorithms
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for graphing and visualization

In addition, a number of programs output data to text in a format that can be
read by the freeware plotting program [Gnuplot](http://gnuplot.info).

Enrolled students can access the [course Canvas
website](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/372547) for more information.
